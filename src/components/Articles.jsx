              Hello! My name is Jonathan Cavia, I'm persuing a Computer science
              degree in the Universidad de la Patagonia San Juan Bosco. I've
              worked in a broad range of IT related labors, from installing
              cameras and surveillance systems, designing and developing
              programs for the government in VB.NET, to making educative
              demonstrational programs in Python. Now I'm currently learning web
              development and i'm liking it so far, and that's what really
              matters so I'm gonna keep going because to like computer science
              is a lifelong learning journey.

          If the quote is true, then all programmers are great artists. We live
          in an age of stackoverflow and copy-paste. Altough this wasn't copy
          paste per se, I did not come up with any of the building blocks that
          made this website, that's the work of much, much smarter people than
          me. The people that invented HTML, CSS, javascript, etc. I just made
          the blocks fit in a way that looked nice to me.

              This is my first web form, discovering the powerful aspect of

              before doing this all I could imagine when i tought of an user
              interface in a form was some old grey-looking Windows form from
              the early 2000's.

              It's not really a tribute, I say some facts that do not leave his
